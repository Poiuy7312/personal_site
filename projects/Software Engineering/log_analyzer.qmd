#### Time

> Time tracks one specified point of data over a specified period i.e. errors per hour or avg bytes per hour.

### Display different plots

Currently only one plot can be made at a time you can chose the x and y axis or if you just want to track something based on time then you pick the y axis.

##### Sort by Time:

Currently the logs can be sorted by second up to year. For example if you want to sort them by an hour then the graph the results will have points of data that have been collected over an hour. The data given will be errors occurred with in the hour, avg bytes transferred by hour.
