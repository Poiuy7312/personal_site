## Description

These are digital collages that are meant to recreate a feeling or tone I felt while playing through a game and/or watching a specific scene in a movie there supposed to be reminiscent of cinematic shots while also being distinct environment in and of themselves. Originally they were going to form some sort of narrative which I found tedious and restricted my creativity in a way. They were all made with a combination of Photoshop and illustrator with photos from unsplash and concept art from differing games and movies.
